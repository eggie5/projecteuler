#A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,

#a2 + b2 = c2
#For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

#There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
#Find the product abc.


#I just did the math on paper w/ this one then had wolfram alpha spit out the possible answers of the system.
